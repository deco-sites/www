This guide shows you how to create and configure a website on
[**deco.cx**](http://deco.cx) for a _storefront_ that reads platform data from
ecommerce [VTEX](https://vtex.com/ "https://vtex.com/").

## Prerequisites

- Access to
  [https://deco.cx/admin](https://deco.cx/admin "https://deco.cx/admin").
- An `accountName` VTEX
  [(help)](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/what-is-an-account-name--i0mIGLcg3QyEy8OCicEoC "https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/what-is-an-account -name--i0mIGLcg3QyEy8OCicEoC").


[**deco.cx**](http://deco.cx) is made especially for creating high performance
commerce experiences, and in this guide we will teach you how to give the first
steps to set up a _deco_ site that reads data from a VTEX account.

## Creating the website

To proceed, follow the steps in the guide [[Documentation deco/Guides: Get
started use Live]] and **select the Deco Commerce template in site creation.**

Complete all the steps in the guide, finally **cloning the site repository newly
created locally.**

After that, you should have a _deco_ storefront created and you should be
running the site locally on your machine.

## Setting the account name

The **Deco Commerce** template already has an automatic connection with VTEX,
however a test account (`bravtexfashionstore`) is used which must be replaced
with the account you intend to develop the store with. that will be useful for
setting up shelves with actual products from the store being developed and also
ensure that the product page and Minicart work correctly.

To make this change, follow these steps:

1. Access your site's administrative panel at
   [https://deco.cx/admin](https://deco.cx/admin "https://deco.cx/admin").

2. Go to **Library.**

3. In the **Global Sections** group, select the item **vtexconfig.global.tsx.**

4. In Account, change `bravtexfashionstore` by the desired account name.

5. Click on **Save Draft**

If necessary, also change settings such as the sales channel (_sales channel)_
and the language of the store.

To test the changes, go back to the list of Sections in the Library and select
the **ProductShelf.** This Section can be configured to search for products in
VTEX with a given configuration. Click the pen icon (‚úèÔ∏è) and edit the field
**Query** for some keyword related to the account catalog you configured (eg if
it's a furniture store, type _"table")._

> If you have not yet configured an integration with VTEX, click on the arrows
> üîÅ or **"Add Integration"** and select the option **vtexProductList** and
> configure the integration by adding a value to the fields **Query** and
> **Count**

When clicking on a product, it is also expected that its detail page (PDP)
render correctly according to the selected product. Now you can use the Sections
and Functions already included in your project to display configured account
products.

## Configuring checkout

Currently, we use the
[same strategy VTEX FastStore uses](https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/platform-integration/vtex/integrating-vtex-checkout "https://www.faststore.dev/how- to-guides/platform-integration/vtex/integrating-vtex-checkout")
to integrate with VTEX Checkout, so **a domain is required secondary that is
linked to the VTEX account.** By clicking the **Finish button Purchase** on the
Minicart on the _deco_ site, the user is redirected to
`https://{dominioConfigurado}/checkout?orderFormId=(‚Ä¶)` and manages to finish
the flow normally.

It is likely that the account you set up above already has a public domain that
is being used, and it is possible to use it in the construction stage of the
store. With that domain in hand, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Minicart.tsx` file and replace the string
   [`https://bravtexfashionstore.vtexcommercestable.com.br`](https://bravtexfashionstore.vtexcommercestable.com.br)
   by the chosen domain of the store.

2. Open the `checkout.ts` file and replace the string
   [`bravtexfashionstore`](https://bravtexfashionstore.vtexcommercestable.com.br)
   by the **account name** used in the previous session
