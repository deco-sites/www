Client-side loaders invocation is a powerful feature of live.ts that allows you
to fetch data directly from your loaders without sending JavaScript to the
browser. This feature ensures that your data fetching is unique across your
repository and helps reduce latency on the client-side.

To get started with client-side loaders invocation, follow these steps:

1. Import `Runtime` from `runtime.ts`

2. Now you can issue invocations using the `Runtime.invoke` function. For
   example, to fetch data from a loader function, you would use the following
   code:

> Can't find this file?
> [Try this one](https://github.com/deco-sites/fashion/blob/main/runtime.ts)

```ts
import { Runtime } from "./runtime.ts";

const data = await Runtime.invoke({
  key: "path/to/your/loader",
  props: {/* your loader input props */},
});
```

Here, the `invoke` function takes an object with a `key` property that specifies
the path to your loader function and a props property that contains your loader
input props. When you call `Runtime.invoke`, live.ts will invoke your loader as
it does for rendering sections and return it to you as a JavaScript object.

You can also batch requests by passing an object with multiple keys, each
representing a desired invocation. For example:

```ts
const { data1, data2 } = await Runtime.invoke({
  data1: {
    key: "path/to/your/loader1",
    props: {/* your loader input props */},
  },
  data2: {
    key: "path/to/your/loader2",
    props: {/* your loader input props */},
  },
});
```

Finally, you can select which properties you want to return from your data
object by using the `select` property. This property takes an array of paths
(separated by `.`) that you want to return. For example:

```ts
const data = await Runtime.invoke({
  key: "path/to/your/loader",
  props: {/* your loader input props */},
  select: ["prop1", "prop2.subprop"],
});
```

This code will fetch the data from your loader and return only the `prop1` and
`prop2.subprop` properties.

With these steps, you can now start using client-side loaders invocation in your
Live.ts application, happy coding!
